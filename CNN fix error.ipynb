'''
Without shuffle=True, the model sees the same order of samples every epoch.
This can cause the model to overfit the order or learn less general features.'''

trainiter=iter(train_loader)
images,labels=next(trainiter) 
#In Python, next() is not a method of an iterator object â€” 
#it's a built-in function that should be used like this:
images.shape
